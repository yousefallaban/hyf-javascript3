Homework assignment :
Create a single-page application with a text box and a submit button.
When the user types a github username into the text box, 
the page should (without refreshing) display a list of all repos for that github user,
as well as the most recent committers name and photo.
If a new github username is typed in (and the submit button pressed),
the page should clear existing contents and replace it with the repo information for the newer user.
